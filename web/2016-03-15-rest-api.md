# REST APIs

 - Why REST?
 - Why JSON?

**Design**

- Base URL
- Resource
- Resource Format
- Content Negotiation
- Query Parameters
- Pagination
- Errors
- Security
- Caching & ETags
- Rate Limiting
- Multi Tenancy
- Maintenance

## HTTP Verbs

Use HTTP Verbs to Make Your Requests Mean Something
API consumers are capable of sending `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` verbs, which greatly enhance the clarity of a given request. ([source](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/restquicktips.html))

Generally, the four primary HTTP verbs are used as follows:

**GET**
Read a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources.

**PUT**
Update a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources. Can also be used to create a specific resource if the resource identifier is know before-hand.

**DELETE**
Remove/delete a specific resource by an identifier.

**POST**
Create a new resource. Also a catch-all verb for operations that don't fit into the other categories.

## HTTP Status Codes

Suggested usages for the **"Top 10" HTTP Response Status Codes** are as follows ([source](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/restquicktips.html)):

`200 OK`
General success status code. This is the most common code. Used to indicate success.

`201 CREATED`
Successful creation occurred (via either POST or PUT). Set the Location header to contain a link to the newly-created resource (on POST). Response body content may or may not be present.

`204 NO CONTENT`
Indicates success but nothing is in the response body, often used for DELETE and PUT operations.

`400 BAD REQUEST`
General error for when fulfilling the request would cause an invalid state. Domain validation errors, missing data, etc. are some examples.

`401 UNAUTHORIZED`
Error code response for missing or invalid authentication token.

`403 FORBIDDEN`
Error code for when the user is not authorized to perform the operation or the resource is unavailable for some reason (e.g. time constraints, etc.).

`404 NOT FOUND`
Used when the requested resource is not found, whether it doesn't exist or if there was a 401 or 403 that, for security reasons, the service wants to mask.

`405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED`
Used to indicate that the requested URL exists, but the requested HTTP method is not applicable. For example, POST /users/12345 where the API doesn't support creation of resources this way (with a provided ID). The Allow HTTP header must be set when returning a 405 to indicate the HTTP methods that are supported. In the previous case, the header would look like "Allow: GET, PUT, DELETE"

`409 CONFLICT`
Whenever a resource conflict would be caused by fulfilling the request. Duplicate entries, such as trying to create two customers with the same information, and deleting root objects when cascade-delete is not supported are a couple of examples.

`500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`
Never return this intentionally. The general catch-all error when the server-side throws an exception. Use this only for errors that the consumer cannot address from their end.


**More Comprehensive HTTP Status Code from** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes



`200 OK` - Response to a successful GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE. Can also be used for a POST that doesn't result in a creation.

`201 Created` - Response to a POST that results in a creation. Should be combined with a Location header pointing to the location of the new resource

`204 No Content` - Response to a successful request that won't be returning a body (like a DELETE request)

`304 Not Modified` - Used when HTTP caching headers are in play

`400 Bad Request` - The request is malformed, such as if the body does not parse

`401 Unauthorized` - When no or invalid authentication details are provided. Also useful to trigger an auth popup if the API is used from a browser

`403 Forbidden` - When authentication succeeded but authenticated user doesn't have access to the resource

`404 Not Found` - When a non-existent resource is requested

`409 Conflict` - Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates.

`405 Method Not Allowed` - When an HTTP method is being requested that isn't allowed for the authenticated user

`409 Conflict` - Whenever a resource conflict would be caused by fulfilling the request. Duplicate entries, such as trying to create two customers with the same information, and deleting root objects when cascade-delete is not supported are a couple of examples.

`410 Gone` - Indicates that the resource at this end point is no longer available. Useful as a blanket response for old API versions

`415 Unsupported Media Type` - If incorrect content type was provided as part of the request

`422 Unprocessable Entity` - Used for validation errors

`429 Too Many Requests` - When a request is rejected due to rate limiting

`500 Internal Server Error` - A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.[60]

`501 Not Implemented` - The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request.

`502 Bad Gateway` - The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.[62]

`503 Service Unavailable`

### REST API Best practices

#### Where to put parameters?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4024271/rest-api-best-practices-where-to-put-parameters?answertab=votes#tab-top

Compare:
1. As part of the URL-path (i.e. /api/resource/parametervalue )
2. As a query argument (i.e. /api/resource?parameter=value )
