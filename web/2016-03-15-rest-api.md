# REST APIs

 - Why REST?
 - Why JSON?

**Design**

- Base URL
- Resource
- Resource Format
- Content Negotiation
- Query Parameters
- Pagination
- Errors
- Security
- Caching & ETags
- Rate Limiting
- Multi Tenancy
- Maintenance

## HTTP status codes

Selected HTTP Status Code from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

- `200 OK` - Response to a successful GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE. Can also be used for a POST that doesn't result in a creation.
- `201 Created` - Response to a POST that results in a creation. Should be combined with a Location header pointing to the location of the new resource
- `204 No Content` - Response to a successful request that won't be returning a body (like a DELETE request)
- `304 Not Modified` - Used when HTTP caching headers are in play
- `400 Bad Request` - The request is malformed, such as if the body does not parse
- `401 Unauthorized` - When no or invalid authentication details are provided. Also useful to trigger an auth popup if the API is used from a browser
- `403 Forbidden` - When authentication succeeded but authenticated user doesn't have access to the resource
- `404 Not Found` - When a non-existent resource is requested
- `409 Conflict` - Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates.
- `405 Method Not Allowed` - When an HTTP method is being requested that isn't allowed for the authenticated user
- `410 Gone` - Indicates that the resource at this end point is no longer available. Useful as a blanket response for old API versions
- `415 Unsupported Media Type` - If incorrect content type was provided as part of the request
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` - Used for validation errors
- `429 Too Many Requests` - When a request is rejected due to rate limiting
- `500 Internal Server Error` - A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.[60]
- `501 Not Implemented` - The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request.
- `502 Bad Gateway` - The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.[62]
503 Service Unavailable

### REST API Best practices

#### Where to put parameters?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4024271/rest-api-best-practices-where-to-put-parameters?answertab=votes#tab-top

Compare:
1. As part of the URL-path (i.e. /api/resource/parametervalue )
2. As a query argument (i.e. /api/resource?parameter=value )
