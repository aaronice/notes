# Web Tooling

> Historically speaking, there have been many build systems. Make is perhaps the best known, and is still a viable option. To make things easier, specialized task runners, such as Grunt and Gulp appeared. Plugins available through npm made both task runners powerful.

> Task runners are great tools on a high level. They allow you to perform operations in a cross-platform manner. The problems begin when you need to splice various assets together and produce bundles. This is the reason we have bundlers, such as Browserify or Webpack.

> Continuing further on this path, JSPM pushes package management directly to the browser. It relies on System.js, a dynamic module loader. Unlike Browserify and Webpack, it skips the bundling step altogether during development. You can generate a production bundle using it, however. Glen Maddern goes into good detail at his video about JSPM.

> **The Short Answer**

> It is easy to decide which tools you need:

> - Small projects can get away with just an ES6 compiler
> - Single Page Apps need a module bundler too
> - Once your app is in production, use a task runner to automate anything else

> And here are the packages which fulfil these requirements:

> - For compiling and polyfilling ES6, use Babel
> - For bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, use Webpack
> - If your have other tasks like renaming files to avoid caching or publishing to the web, automate them with Gulp
